# Fake Store App

## Module 4 Final Project

This project is a simple e-commerce dashboard built with React and Bootstrap. It allows users to browse products, edit product details, and manage inventory. The application fetches product data from an API and provides an interface for updating and deleting products.

## Project Overview

The application features:

- A product listing page displaying all available products.
- A product details page with an option to edit or delete products.
- A form for updating product information.
- API integration with `FakeStoreAPI` to fetch and modify product data.

## Development Process

AI tools were used to generate basic UI components, such as cards and forms, to speed up the development process. I also used AI to help me generate and edit an effective Read Me. The generated components were then customized to meet specific project requirements. The UI is built using Bootstrap for a responsive design. This project serves as a foundation for building a more complex e-commerce platform with additional features.
